# Hotel-Data-Analysis
Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to your stakeholders. In this Hotel project, I will be using SQL server to analyze the data first. And then, I will visualize the data and create a chart on Power BI by importing the SQL statements.

## Data Analysis Project Pipeline
1) Build a Database
2) Develop the SQL Query
3) Connect Power BI to the Database
4) Visualize
5) Summarize Findings

## Questions which we will answer by visualization 

1) Is our hotel revenue growing by year?

--> We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.

2) Should we increase our parking lot size?

--> We want to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars.

3) What trends can we see in the data?

--> Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality
